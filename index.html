		<p>Initial Topic Ideas: </p>
<ul>
<li>Why your recycling isnâ€™t being recycled</li>
<li>How unsustainable is your Social Media usage?</li>
<li>Why data can be misleading</li> </ul>

<p>I then started looking further into deceiving data and how creating a website about how to navigate misleading data visualisation could be helpful. I was planning on creating the site "The Art of Distortion: Exploring Deceptive Data Visualisation" although I thought that the concept could be even more helpful and insightful for young children that are learning to navigate the web.

<p>The "Data Deception Detectives" website offers a comprehensive resource designed to educate children about the nuances of data and statistics, with a focus on identifying deceptive practices. Through engaging content and interactive activities, this platform empowers young minds to develop critical thinking skills when encountering data-driven information acting as a detective.

The website explores real-world examples of how statistics can be misleading, fostering a deep understanding of concepts like sampling bias, data visualisation, and correlation vs. causation. It encourages academic exploration by providing references to credible sources and offering challenges to develop statistical literacy. "Data Deception Detectives" serves as a valuable resource for educators seeking to instil a foundation of data scepticism and analytical thinking in the next generation.
