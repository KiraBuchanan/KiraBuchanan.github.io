		<h2>Task 1</h2>
		<a id="TASK_1"> </a>
		<p>Initial Topic Ideas: </p>
<ul>
<li>Why your recycling isn’t being recycled</li>
<li>How unsustainable is your Social Media usage?</li>
<li>Why data can be misleading</li> 
</ul>


<p>I then started looking further into deceiving data and how creating a website about how to navigate misleading data visualisation could be helpful. I was planning on creating the site "The Art of Distortion: Exploring Deceptive Data Visualisation" although I thought that the concept could be even more helpful and insightful for young children that are learning to navigate the web.
</p>

<p>I have chosen this topic as I think it is crucial for children growing up in a digital age to be able to navigate and decipher data and statistics that are presented to them. This skill is vital in the avoidance of misinformation and deceptive sources. I believe that data literacy and interpreting statistics should be a key learning objective in the information age throughout education and that presenting the topic in an interactive, entertaining way will create the most engaging and memorable learning experience for children.
</p>


<p>The "Data Deception Detectives" website offers a comprehensive resource designed to educate children about the nuances of data and statistics, with a focus on identifying deceptive practices. Through engaging content and interactive activities, this platform empowers young minds to develop critical thinking skills when encountering data-driven information acting as a detective. The website explores real-world examples of how statistics can be misleading, fostering a deep understanding of concepts like sampling bias, data visualisation, and correlation vs. causation. It encourages academic exploration by providing references to credible sources and offering challenges to develop statistical literacy. "Data Deception Detectives" serves as a valuable resource for educators seeking to instil a foundation of data scepticism and analytical thinking in the next generation.

		<p>The choice to target children aged 8-10 for the "Data Deception Detectives" website is rooted in the recognition that early exposure to critical thinking skills and data literacy is crucial in today's information-driven world. During this developmental stage, children are increasingly curious and receptive to new concepts, making it an opportune time to introduce them to the complexities of data and statistics. Interactive platforms and games align with the preferences of children in this age group, ensuring that the learning experience is both enjoyable and memorable.

Drawing from personal memories of engaging with educational content during childhood, this website aims to provide a similar sense of excitement and discovery while imparting valuable life skills. Ultimately, targeting this age group with a fun, informative, and interactive resource sets a solid foundation for fostering data scepticism and analytical thinking in the next generation, equipping them to navigate the information landscape with confidence.
