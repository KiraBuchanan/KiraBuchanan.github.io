		<a id="TASK_1"> </a>
		<p>Initial Topic Ideas: </p>
<ul>
<li>Why your recycling isn’t being recycled</li>
<li>Spotting Fake News</li>
<li>Safety in online communities</li> 
<li>How unsustainable is your Social Media usage?</li>
<li>How and why can data be misleading</li> 
</ul>


<p>I then started looking further into deceiving data and how creating a website about how to navigate misleading data visualisation could be helpful. I was planning on creating the site "The Art of Distortion: Exploring Deceptive Data Visualisation" although I thought that the concept could be even more helpful and insightful for young children that are learning to navigate the web.
</p>

<p>I have chosen this topic as I think it is crucial for children growing up in a digital age to be able to navigate and decipher data and statistics that are presented to them. This skill is vital in the avoidance of misinformation and deceptive sources. I believe that data literacy and interpreting statistics should be a key learning objective in the information age throughout education and that presenting the topic in an interactive, entertaining way will create the most engaging and memorable learning experience for children.
</p>


<p>The "Data Deception Detectives" website offers a comprehensive resource designed to educate children about the nuances of data and statistics, with a focus on identifying deceptive practices. Through engaging content and interactive activities, this platform empowers young minds to develop critical thinking skills when encountering data-driven information acting as a detective. The website explores real-world examples of how statistics can be misleading, fostering a deep understanding of concepts like sampling bias, data visualisation, and correlation vs. causation. It encourages academic exploration by providing references to credible sources and offering challenges to develop statistical literacy. "Data Deception Detectives" serves as a valuable resource for educators seeking to instil a foundation of data scepticism and analytical thinking in the next generation.

Remember, every number has a tale to tell, and you're just the detective to discover it! Ready for some playful puzzles to test your new skills?"</p>

    <h3><strong>Level 2: The Case of the Tricky Graphs</strong></h3>
    <p>"Now that we've mastered data basics, let's dive into the mysterious world of graphs, detectives! Graphs can be super helpful, like a treasure map leading us to hidden information. But watch out – sometimes, they can be tricky and misleading. In this level, we'll use colourful, interactive examples to learn how to spot the difference between helpful graphs and those sneaky ones trying to fool us. Let's play 'Spot the Difference' with some graphs and learn how to tell if a graph is being honest or trying to trick us. Let's crack the code of these tricky graphs together!"</p>

    <h3><strong>Level 3: Sampling Secrets Unveiled</strong></h3>
    <p>"Great job on solving the tricky graphs, detectives! Now, let's uncover the secrets of sampling. What if I told you that by looking at just a few pieces of a puzzle, you could guess the whole picture? That's what sampling is all about. But be careful – if we don't choose our puzzle pieces wisely, we might get the wrong picture! Through engaging games and real-world scenarios, we’ll see how a good sample can tell us a lot, and a bad one can lead us to the wrong conclusions. Let's put on our detective hats and unlock the secrets of sampling together!"</p>

    <p>The narrative paragraphs effectively communicate data concepts in a way that is easy for young children to understand. Using an active voice, they engage readers directly, as seen in phrases like "Let's explore through fun games and animations."

<p>When comparing images from websites on a similar topic, particularly those aimed at explaining data concepts to a young audience, it's crucial to consider how the imagery aligns with the needs and comprehension levels of children. In this case, the images encountered are primarily tailored for adults (educators and parents) which can lead to a disconnect when children are the end-users.</p>

<p>For children, the effectiveness of an image is often measured by how well it can translate complex ideas into simple, engaging visuals that capture their imagination and aid in retention. Images that work well for adults, such as real-world photographs or abstract illustrations, may not hold the same appeal or clarity for a younger demographic. In contrast, images that can tell a story, with characters they can relate to or scenarios they find familiar, are more likely to resonate with children and facilitate learning.<p/>

<p>These images, while aesthetically pleasing and designed to break the monotony of text, fall short in terms of educational utility for children. They don't necessarily contribute to a better grasp of the material, as they are not designed with the cognitive and perceptual abilities of children in mind. For instance, a photograph of child behind a laptop might be relevant to an educator-focused site, but it doesn't engage a child who is trying to understand data through play and exploration.</p>

<p>To make the images more suitable for a child's learning experience, it's important to pivot towards visuals that are character-driven, vibrant, and narrative-based. These could take the form of colourful cartoons or interactive diagrams that allow children to see the progression of a story or concept as they interact with it. This approach not only makes the learning process more enjoyable but also ensures that the imagery is directly contributing to the educational goals of the website.</p>

<p>While the existing images may enhance the visual appeal of the websites but miss the mark in effectiveness for children. A child-centric approach to imagery would necessitate a shift towards more illustrative, interactive, and story-based visuals that align with the way children process information and stay engaged with educational content.</p>

<h3>Assessing the Quality of Images on my Website</h3>
<p>
Optimising images for a child-oriented website like "Digit Detective" involves balancing visual appeal with technical performance. Considering the Fidelity Criteria, aiming for 'Fine' quality images ensures that the visuals are engaging without being unnecessarily large in file size, which could impact site loading times.
Vector images are an excellent choice for this type of site due to their scalability and clear graphics, perfect for line art, illustrations with text, and images requiring transparency. Utilising PNG format for these vector images takes advantage of lossless compression, preserving visual quality while often reducing file size for faster load times.</p>
<p>For the web, optimising images also includes proper sizing and resolution. Since the target audience is children, who may be viewing the site on various devices, images should be responsive, ensuring they look sharp on high-resolution displays while being scaled down appropriately for smaller screens.
Overall, the strategy would be to create a colourful, visually rich experience that aligns with the 'Fine' quality standard, using well-optimised vector graphics to ensure the site is responsive and loads quickly across all devices. This approach supports an engaging, educational experience without compromising on speed or accessibility.</p>

<h3>Haunted By Nostalgia</h3>
    
    <p><a href="https://haunted.thedigitalpanda.com/" target="_blank">Haunted By Nostalgia</a></p>

    <p>I explored the 'Haunted By Nostalgia' interactive quiz from Awwwards' showcase of websites featuring audio. This game engages users with a journey through a spooky house, each room echoing with iconic items from horror films. Accompanying the eerie visuals, an unsettling tune and ambient noises like wind set a haunting atmosphere. Interactive sounds, such as the squeak of a door and the groan of floorboards, respond to navigation and selections. Correct answers prompt playful giggles, while errors are met with sinister laughter, both examples of diegetic sounds triggered by the users’ actions. The background track subtly enhances the experience, while the reactive sounds of footsteps and laughter, directly linked to on-screen actions, deepen immersion. The digital audio usage is carefully curated to enhance the immersive experience.</p>

    <p>All of these elements are used with clear intent to augment the horror and thriller quiz theme and contribute to a suspenseful atmosphere, aiding in information retention and appeal. The site's design intuitively guides the user through the 'creepy old house,' with audio cues complementing visual signifiers, indicating progression and areas of interest. Navigation is seamless, with clear indications of where the user has been and can go, supported by audio-visual consistency. The design choice to recommend headphones suggests that the creators are aware of the audio's impact and are maximizing its potential to deliver a powerful, unified multimedia narrative. The advantages of this audio use are a heightened emotional engagement and a more memorable user experience. However, the reliance on audio means that without sound, the experience could be less engaging, and there's a risk of overstimulation with too many audio cues.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Audience: The project is clearly aimed at horror and thriller enthusiasts. The depth of material and spooky interactive elements are well-suited to this audience, providing a feedback loop through audio cues that reflect the user's choices.</li>

    <li>Affordances and Navigation: The purpose of the quiz game is clear, and navigation is intuitive, with audio cues signifying movement and actions within the game. The audio aids in orientation within the virtual space, signalling interactions.</li>

    <li>Design Principles: The site effectively employs contrast in its visuals and audio, aligning the eerie sounds with the dark visual theme. The layout is consistent, and audio cues are used repeatedly to establish a pattern, aiding navigation.</li>

    <li>Content Design: The content is highly relevant to horror fans and is presented in an engaging and interactive format. Audio enhances the content by deepening the thematic experience, and the design shows a wider knowledge of horror and thriller films.</li>

<h3>Optimising Video for Web use</h3>

<p>I chose two videos from<a href="https://pixabay.com/videos/" target="_blank">Pixabay</a>that aligned with my website's theme. The first video was enhanced with the addition of a title card, transitions, and filtered effects to create a more finished look. To further enrich the media content on my website, I integrated an upbeat audio track that I developed in week 8. This video is an example of the type of content that would be suitable for my sites launch page. Below, you can view the original master file video alongside my edited version, which has been exported in different quality levels: low, medium, and high.</p>

<p>In further exploration, I utilized the second video chosen for a new edit, once again employing a title card and filtered effects for consistency. This time, I delved deeper into OpenShot's features, experimenting with playing segments in reverse, and fading out the background music. Additionally, I also integrated an audio clip gathered in week 8, adding another layer to the multimedia experience.</p>

	<h2>Task 10</h2>
		<a id="TASK_10"> </a>
<h3>WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</h3>
    <p>Upon evaluating the accessibility of loharris.com, the web accessibility evaluation tool flagged several issues. Firstly, the website fails to specify the language, which is crucial for screen readers and automatic translation services. The absence of first-level headings (which occurred 77 times) hinders navigation for those using assistive technologies and diminishes the document's structural clarity. Additionally, the site contains elements with insufficient contrast, posing challenges for users with visual impairments. There are also issues with missing ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) references, leading to descriptions not being properly relayed to users. The presence of empty links creates confusion, as their function or purpose is unclear to screen reader and keyboard users. Finally, the website has numerous redundant links, which result in unnecessary repetition and navigation complications for these users.</p>
    <img src="images/Week10_wavetool.png" alt="WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool screenshot" style="width: 30vw;">

    <h3>WebAIM Contrast Checker</h3>
    <p>The use of contrast and colour plays an essential role in making web content accessible. It is imperative for all users, particularly those with visual impairments, to be able to discern the content presented on a webpage. Contrast refers to the difference in "luminance" or brightness that makes an object (such as text) distinguishable from another (such as its background). This difference is quantified as a ratio, with the scale ranging from 1:1 to 21:1. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) established by Web Accessibility in Mind (WebAIM) stipulate that text and images of text must have a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 to ensure readability. However, an evaluation using the WebAIM contrast checker indicated that a significant portion of the text on the Lo Harris website does not meet this requisite contrast ratio, potentially compromising text accessibility.</p>
    <img src="images/Week10_contrastchecker.png" alt="WebAIM Contrast Checker screenshot" style="width: 30vw;">

    <h3>Readability Test Tool</h3>
    <p>The readability test indicated that the website's content is clear enough for comprehension by users as young as 12 to 13 years old, as revealed by a score of 63.8. While the site is not specifically aimed at a younger demographic, the findings affirm that its content is easily accessible and understandable to a broad spectrum of users.</p>
    <img src="images/Week10_readabilitytool.png" alt="Readability Test Tool screenshot" style="width: 30vw;">

<h3>Evaluating the Accessibility of my Website</h3>
<p>Gaining a deeper understanding of web accessibility has led me to re-evaluate my design process and recognize areas for improvement. The use of vibrant, child-friendly colours has been a central feature of my site, yet I've overlooked the importance of contrast ratio for content visibility. Tools like the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool have shed light on several design elements that I hadn't fully considered in terms of accessibility for screen readers and other assistive technologies. While I have successfully implemented some accessible features highlighted by the tool, such as language specification, headings, alt text, and functional links, there is still a need to assess how my proposed interactive features will interact with assistive devices.</p>

<h3>Creating Captions</h3>
<video controls>
        <source src="video/week9_highquality.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        <track label="English" kind="captions" srclang="en" src="captions.vtt" default>
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
    <p>Master File from Week 9 with added captions</p> 

<h3>Reflecting on accessibility</h3>
<h3>Keyboard Navigation:</h3>
    <p>It is essential to ensure that all interactive elements, such as links, buttons, form fields, and media controls, can be accessed using the keyboard alone. This means that users should be able to navigate through every part of the website using tab keys, arrow keys, and other standard keyboard shortcuts. Users with motor disabilities may find using a mouse challenging or impossible, and those with visual impairments often rely on screen readers that are navigated by keyboard. When developing my site in MAD(B) I need to provide focus indicators, provide a logical navigation order and use links and buttons appropriately.</p>
    <p>Useful Resource for next semester - <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/" target="_blank"><strong>WebAIM: Keyboard Accessibility</strong></a></p>

    <h3>Avoid Seizure-Inducing Content:</h3>
    <p>Content that flashes, blinks, or flickers can pose a serious health risk to users with photosensitive epilepsy. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend avoiding flashing that is more frequent than three times per second to prevent seizures. When developing my site in MAD(B) I need to be wary of mouse-over effects, avoid red flashing and comply with WCAG guidelines.</p>
    <p>Useful resource for next semester - <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Seizure_disorders" target="_blank"><strong>MDN Web Docs: Seizure Disorders</strong></a></p>

    <h3>Testing with Users:</h3>
    <p>Including people with disabilities in the user testing process is invaluable. First-hand feedback from users with a range of disabilities can provide insights that automated tools cannot. Engaging with this diverse group can help identify practical issues and barriers that might not be obvious otherwise.</p>
